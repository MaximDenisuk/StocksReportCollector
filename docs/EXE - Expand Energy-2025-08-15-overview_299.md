## BLOCK B: DETAILS

### What is Next?

**Target Price Matrix:**

- **1-Week Target:** $98.00  
- **2-Week Target:** $100.00  
- **1-Month Target:** $105.00  
- **3-Month Target:** $110.00  

The plan accommodates potential short-term rebounds, leveraging technical support levels and capitalizing on improved operational efficiencies and analyst sentiment.

### Broader Context and Strategic Considerations:

1. **Valuation Relative to Peers:**  
   - Compared to peers like Surge Energy Inc. and Baytex Energy, EXE lacks in short-term revenue growth metrics but has analysts backing its potential recovery.

2. **Recent Developments and Catalysts:**  
   - Zacksâ€™ upgrade to a Strong Buy due to upward revised earnings projections.
   - Successful integration of a major acquisition which has resulted in operational efficiencies.

3. **Financial Health and Growth Projections:**  
   - Although net income is negative due to recent challenges, forecasted earnings growth is substantial (422.7% increase in EPS for FY2025).
   - Competitive forward P/E ratio further supports potential investor interest.

4. **Technical Analysis:**  
   - Trading below key moving averages suggests caution, yet RSI at near oversold levels presents an entry point opportunity.
   - Anticipated rebound supported by approaching key support level ($98.17).

5. **Risk Factors and Mitigation:**  
   - Potential risks include unforeseen operational setbacks or competition, thus a stop-loss is set at $92 to mitigate further loss.
   - Small position size (5% of portfolio) to manage exposure to volatility, recognizing EXE's speculative nature in the short-term context.

6. **Conclusion:**  
   While EXE is currently underperforming in comparison to both peers and benchmarks, the combination of technical conditions, analyst upgrades, and the strategic path forward following integration activities makes it a reasonable speculative buy for short-term investors aiming to leverage a momentum trade.

Given the dynamics in play, and unless negative disruption or contrary news arise, investors should monitor performance closely and adjust strategies accordingly.
